Simple, lightweight bike trainer interface script. The eventual goal is to turn this into an application for indoor bike training without distractions and maximal data, as well as a realistic physics model for more accurate real world cycle simulation.

Uses pycycling for the trainer interface and bleak for bluetooth.

I have tested this on a wahoo kickr core trainer, using a garmin chest strap HRM is also supported. This *Should* support any modern trainer over bluetooth, but I can't afford to buy every major trainer on the market to test.
